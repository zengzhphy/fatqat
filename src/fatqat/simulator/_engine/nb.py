"""Numba matrix-family engines.

`NumbaSVEngine` (statevector) and `NumbaDMEngine` (density matrix) reuse
the static capability reporting, materialization, local execution, and
``initialize`` / ``measure_subsystems`` orchestration of their NumPy twins,
while replacing numeric kernels with Numba-jitted loops. `NumbaUnitaryEngine`
and `NumbaSuperopEngine` then reuse *those* kernels for the operator
representations, overriding only the apply plan (see the operator-engine
section at the bottom). All four are reachable via
``Simulator(method=..., runtime="numba")``.

Kernel selection is key-driven: an `ApplyMatrixStep` carries the canonical
identity of the implementation that produced its matrix (``kernel_key``), and
each engine resolves which specialized kernel a step gets once per plan - by
declared identity or one `_classify_matrix` content scan, never per application
or per shot. `_KERNEL_SPECS` is the statevector key-to-structure table; the
density matrix derives its table from the same declarations because the
Kronecker product preserves structure (see below).

- `NumbaSVEngine` replaces gate application (`apply` / `_apply_local`),
  `probabilities`, `sample_indices`, and `collapse`. ``measure_subsystems`` /
  ``reset_subsystems`` delegate to those, so they are Numba-routed without an
  override.
- `NumbaDMEngine` replaces `apply` / `apply_channel`, `probabilities`,
  `sample_indices`, and `collapse`. It reuses the *same* coset-walk kernels as
  the statevector path by viewing ``rho`` (shape ``(size, size)``) as a flat
  vector over a doubled ``2n``-subsystem system: ``n`` bra subsystems (strides
  ``prod(dims[:q])``) then ``n`` ket subsystems (strides ``size *
  prod(dims[:q])``). The sandwich ``M rho M^dagger`` is the single
  super-operator ``kron(M, conj(M))`` on ``vec(rho)``, and a channel is
  ``sum_i kron(K_i, conj(K_i))`` - each one coset walk over the combined
  ket+bra super-target. The Kronecker product preserves structure, so a gate's
  declared identity transfers to its super-operator: a declared-dense key skips
  the scan, everything else takes one scan of the super-operator, cached per
  step. ``4^n`` is memory-bound and each gate is one pass, so DM parallelizes
  later than the statevector path (`_MIN_SIZE_TO_THREAD_DM`). Reset stays the
  inherited NumPy partial-trace channel.

Noise math lives in ``noise.nb`` (quantum-jump branch selection for the
statevector, the channel super-operator for the density matrix, readout-confusion
resampling, and the compiled multi-shot plan flattening); *applying* a Kraus operator
is a plain local-matrix application on the coset kernels here. This module
imports ``noise.nb``; the reverse is forced never to happen (see its docstring).

The compiled multi-shot statevector channel path weighs branches the way Aer's trajectory
sampler does, not the way the NumPy reference does: instead of materializing
every ``K_i|psi>`` and norming it, it forms the targets' reduced density matrix
``rho_T`` once (`_reduced_density`) and reads each branch probability off it as
``Tr(K_i^dagger K_i rho_T)``, then applies only the chosen operator (see
`_channel_step`). A mathematically equal but numerically distinct estimator, so
it stays seed-reproducible and agrees with NumPy in distribution, not per-seed
bit-for-bit.

The operator engines do not apply gates one at a time. An operator buffer is
``(rows, columns)`` and every step acts on the row index alone, so columns are
independent and a whole plan runs inside one parallel region split over column
blocks (``_NumbaOperatorRunMixin``). Those kernels keep the per-step
accumulation order, so they are bit-identical to the per-gate coset kernels.
When ``fusion=True`` is requested for a supported method, a sufficiently large
plan may merge adjacent operator payloads into wider ones. That rewrite is
equal to the unfused plan only to floating-point tolerance.

Shot threading uses this module's compiled multi-shot loop, while kernel
threading partitions state amplitudes or cosets, or operator columns. Serial
inner kernels use one Numba thread unless the compiled shot loop owns the outer
pool. Process-backed replay uses a one-thread child policy, so process and Numba
thread pools never nest. The compiled multi-shot path is independent of the
optional fusion rewrite.

The RNG draw stays in NumPy - a ``np.random.Generator`` cannot cross into
nopython code - so uniforms are drawn with ``rng`` and the inverse-CDF search
runs in Numba. This consumes the stream identically to ``rng.choice``, so
counts stay reproducible per engine (float-summation differences from NumPy
mean they are not bit-identical across engines - the documented contract,
see `np.py`).

Numba compiles kernels lazily on first call. This module is never imported from
``fatqat.simulator._engine``'s ``__init__``; import it explicitly.

Conventions match `np.py`: private little-endian engine indexing (engine
subsystem ``q`` has place value ``prod(dims[:q])``) and a local gate matrix
whose most-significant index digit is ``targets[0]``. The simulator maps public
subsystems before lowering; reversing an exported buffer here would apply the
mapping twice and allocate an unnecessary full-result copy.

      unitaries, so ``p_i = <psi|K_i^dagger K_i|psi>`` does not depend on the
      state and its cdf is precomputed. No amplitude is read to make the draw,
      and a draw landing on the identity - the dominant branch at any physical
      error rate - returns having touched nothing.
    - otherwise - **quantum-jump weighing**: ``p_i`` equals ``Tr(M_i rho_T)``
      over the targets' reduced density matrix ``rho_T`` (`_reduced_density`;
      ``M_i = K_i^dagger K_i`` precomputed in the channel table), which is
      ``O(size * d + num * d**2)`` against materializing and norming ``num``
      full branches. ``ch_mmat_diag[c]`` narrows that to the ``d`` times
      cheaper `_reduced_diagonal` when every ``M_i`` is diagonal.

    Either way the drawn operator is applied in place at unit norm: the
    Pauli-sampled operators arrive pre-scaled, and a jump branch is divided by
    the ``sqrt(p_chosen)`` the weighing already computed - both on the ``d x d``
    operator, so nothing passes over the state to renormalize. The round-off
    that leaves in the norm is absorbed by `_probabilities_kernel` and
    `_project_kernel`.

    Both consume exactly one uniform ``u``, so which weighing a channel takes
    never shifts the shot's RNG stream.
