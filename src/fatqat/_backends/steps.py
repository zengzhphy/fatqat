"""Resolved execution-plan step types shared by every backend and engine.

A :py:class:`~fatqat.Program` lowers to a `list[ResolvedStep]`: each step is either an
`ApplyMatrixStep` (a local matrix payload built from a matrix-implementation
rule plus layout-resolved target indices), an `ApplyChannelStep` (a Kraus
payload built from a channel-implementation rule, for channel-representable
noise), a `MeasurementStep`, or a `ResetStep`. Defined here, separate from
both `implementation/` / `noise/` (the rule protocols that only ever produce
bare arrays, never a step) and the `simulator/` / `emulator/` packages (which
would otherwise need to import this type from each other and cycle), so every
backend and every engine can import it without depending on one another.
