# User guide

Choose the level of detail that answers your question. Direct simulation and
physics workflows start from the same backend-independent
[`Program`][fatqat.Program]. When mapping and routing are part of the question,
author a [`LogicalProgram`][fatqat.LogicalProgram] for the
[compiler](compiler.md).

!!! tip "New to FatQat?"

    [Build, draw, and run a Bell program](quickstart.md), then learn how to
    [write Programs and registers](program.md). When you are ready to compare
    backends, [choose how much physics to model](execution-models.md).

## Choose an execution path

-   ![Five-qubit variational ansatz](../assets/generated/guide/guide-path-algorithm.png){ loading=lazy width="636" height="409" }

    :material-chart-bell-curve-cumulative: **Explore the algorithm**

    Simulate states, measurements, observables, and parameter sweeps, then
    compare ideal and noisy results or tune performance.

    :material-chip: **Test hardware constraints**

    Check native operations, placement, connectivity, capacity, atom occupancy,
    pairing, and reference noise.

    :material-atom: **Follow the physics**

    Follow calibrated transmon gates and direct pulse controls as continuous
    dynamics, with built-in models for transmons and neutral atoms.

    [Open Hamiltonian emulation :material-arrow-right:](hamiltonian-emulation.md)

</div>

[Compare the execution levels](execution-models.md) if you are unsure which
path contains the detail your study needs.

To compile an editable gate circuit for a superconducting or neutral-atom
target, continue with [Compile a logical circuit](compiler.md).

    The guide teaches complete workflows and the reasoning behind them. Follow a
    link to the [API reference](../api/index.md) when you need a precise signature
    or contract. The [tutorials](../tutorials/index.md) are longer case studies
    built on the same features.
